# MY IDEAS FOR IMPROVEMENTS


### - Use a interface for the drive modes, and any other modes, so that the code isn't repetitive (I did this)

### - Apply the singleton pattern to robot hardware class so that you can't have 2 sets of hardware (I did this)

### - Use the command pattern for the autonomous mode to easier navigate the field

### - Refactor hardcoded values in drive modes into constants (I did this)
